AWS CONCEPTS
-  Introuduction of AWS
  - What is cloud?
    -  In past few years, they used to buy servers to dploy their application in that servers.
    -  Data Cebters is nothing but a place where all the servers stored and configuration are done for the servers are very costly
    -  suppose in our data center each application deployed individual servers once the application configuration as less there lost the memory space in that server
    -  To solve this problem there is a concept called virutaulization, Virutualization is concept where you will solve the problem wasting resources on a server.
    -  Will create virtual server or layers on actual servers .
    -  We can create virtual server anywhere we share with the IP Address.
    -  Where it is a cloud they are interconnected and we don't know where the resources are actually it might be India,USA,Europe.
  - Public vs Private cloud
    -Private cloude to private to your orgainzation. It is with in the boundries of our organization.
    public cloud anybody have an account like AWS,Azure,GCP etc..., they can create EC2 Instances is nothing but virtual machines.
  
  - Why public cloud is so popular?
    - The main concern is maintanace is free and cost is lesserthan onprimises.
  - Trend of people moving back to private cloud?
    - security
    - const Optimization
       
-  IAM (Identity Access Management)
   - IAM is solving a problem Authentication and authorization
   -  Devops Engineer or AWS Admin what would do first create AWS account, when employee joined the compancy te admin or Devops engineer would create IAM Service and create user for particular employee created some policies and permissions to the particular user.
   -  We can Implement Authencaticationa and Authorization using the IAM service
   -  The main components in IAM
           - Users
           - Policies
           - Groups
           - Roles
      Create the user and attaching policies to the user by using policies
      Groups are neede to imporve the efficieny
      Roles  are basically similar to users, but not  100%  same as users, Roles are mostly created for temporary purpose.
      otherway, Roles are created for talking to one AWS account to another AWS accountant.
